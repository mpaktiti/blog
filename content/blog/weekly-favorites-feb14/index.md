### Tweet: Anna's imaginary America

Anna is a teenager that visualized an imaginary America where Chile takes over the entire West Coast of the continent, Wyoming was removed altogether, and the capitol was moved to "Ohio 2" (which was created by unanimous vote of Texas and Ohio). Her father tweeted about it.

I found this creation inspired and I'm waiting for a Netflix series based on this.

You can find the original tweet by Anna's Father here: [Tweet by Craig Calcaterra](https://twitter.com/craigcalcaterra/status/1227594895747141632).

Anna's world went viral and CNN wrote about it: [A high school student redrew a map of the US to feature Ohio 2, Long Texas and no Wyoming. Her goal? To drive us all mad](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/13/us/high-school-student-map-ohio-2-trnd/index.html).

### Website: The truth about input relay

[Jeff Atwood](https://twitter.com/codinghorror) tweeted about an awesome website: [How annoying is too annoying?](https://input-delay.glitch.me/).

The website, created by [Monica Dinculescu](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf), helps you realize what amount of delay is too annoying for a user interaction like typing. Turns out 100ms is not fine at all. Try it out and see for yourselves.

### The new Wes Anderson movie: The French Dispatch

Wes Anderson is my favorite director and he just released a trailer for his new movie, The French Dispatch. The movie features his classic aesthetics and an all-star cast.

> THE FRENCH DISPATCH brings to life a collection of stories from the final issue of an American magazine published in a fictional 20th-century French city. It stars Benicio del Toro, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Léa Seydoux, Frances McDormand, Timothée Chalamet, Lyna Khoudri, Jeffrey Wright, Mathieu Amalric, Stephen Park, Bill Murray and Owen Wilson.

Can't wait for July.

### Online course: The Missing Semester of Your CS Education

I found this online course, [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). It looks very interesting and I plan of following it and writing what I learned.

The motivation behind this course is instructing people on things that our CS classes did not: proficiency with the tools we will be using to do our jobs. I'm already using all these tools but I'm not under the illusion that I know everything about them or I use them in the best way possible.

The course comprises of 11 lectures (about 1 hour long each). You can find all the lectures on YouTube: [Missing Semester IAP 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J).

If you have already followed this course, let me know what you think.

### Tool: Roam

[Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) is a tool that promises to revolutionize the way we are taking notes, and organizing them.

> As easy to use as a document. As powerful as a graph database. Roam helps you organize your research for the long haul.

I used a combo of [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) and [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) until now, but I'd love to find a tool that lets me make lists and take notes, and organize all these in a meaningful way.

I started using Roam today and my first impressions are positive.

It's currently in beta and you can sign up by visiting the website.
