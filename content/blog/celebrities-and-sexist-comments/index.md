Yesterday I watched this video compilation of celebrities replying properly to sexist comments. And I can't get enough of it.

These are the role models we need.

> "Feminism is about equality. I really don't know what my tits have to do with it. It's very confusing." ~ Emma Watson

> "If a man shares his experience in writing, he is sharing. If a woman shares his experience in writing, she is oversharing or overemotional or she might be crazy." ~ Taylor Swift

> "When I'm assertive, I'm a bitch. When a man is assertive, he is The Boss" ~ Nicki Minaj

![Tweet by Ariana Grande: "when will people stop being offended by women showing skin / expressing sexuality? men take their shirts off / express their sexuality on stage, in videos, on instagram, anywhere they want to... all. the. time. the double standard is so boring and exhausting. with all due respect, i think it's time you get your head out of your ass. ? woman can love their bodies too!!?"](ariana-grande-sexuality.png)

As a Friday bonus, here is Taylor Swift's latest video: The Man.
