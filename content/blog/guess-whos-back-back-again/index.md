After three and a half years of procrastination, I'm back.

Life has been busy, some bad things happened and lots of good ones as well.

This is not meant to be an excuse, life is always busy. I just have this love and hate relationship with writing where on one hand I love doing it and on the other I hate it because I never think it's good enough.

But enough of this.

I find myself without a job at the moment and with some extra free time in my hands. And I want to use this free time to write.

Let's see how this goes.
