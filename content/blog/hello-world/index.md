Hey there. My name is Maria. I live in Greece and work remotely as a software engineer.

I haven't decided yet if I am a software engineer who likes writing or a writer who likes software engineering.

I've been coding for over two decades now and I still have no idea what I'm doing. I also have a bad memory so I decided to start this blog to write down things, hoping that this will help me make sense of the world and my code editor.

![Meme saying: I've learned two important lessons in life. I can't recall the first one, but the second one is that I need to start writing stuff down](write-stuff-down.jpg)

That's all for now. Stick around and let me know how I'm doing.
