description: "My favorite graduation speeches over the years."
---

I love a good motivational speech. But usually they don't stay with me. When they do, though, they stay for life. They are texts I return to again and again throughout the years. That I know by heart but still go ahead and read them one more time. I have two such speeches (no, the "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish" speech by Steve Jobs in Stanford is not one of them).

My most favorite speech is over 20 years old and it was never delivered to an audience as a speech. It's the "Wear Sunscreen" by Mary Schmich. It's an essay written as a hypothetical commencement speech, originally published in June 1997 in the Chicago Tribune. Mary Schmich wrote this essay as the commencement speech she would give if she were asked to give one, and I find the text stunning. It talks about a lot of things but my highlight is the unpredictability of life.

It was also made into a song by Baz Luhrmann, "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)".

This is the whole speech (with my favorite parts in bold).

> Ladies and gentlemen of the class of ’97:
>
> Wear Sunscreen.
>
> If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.
>
> Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they’ve faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.
>
> **Don’t worry about the future, or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind. The kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.**
>
> Do one thing every day that scares you.
>
> Sing.
>
> Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts. Don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.
>
> Floss.
>
> Don’t waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind. **The race is long and, in the end, it’s only with yourself.**
>
> Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. **If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.**
>
> Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.
>
> Stretch.
>
> **Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don’t.**
>
> Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You’ll miss them when they’re gone.
>
> Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll have children, maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll divorce at 40, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. **Whatever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else’s.**
>
> Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don’t be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own.
>
> Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but in your living room.
>
> Read the directions, even if you don’t follow them.
>
> Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.
>
> **Get to know your parents. You never know when they’ll be gone for good.** Be nice to your siblings. They’re your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.
>
> Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.
>
> Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.
>
> **Travel.**
>
> Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you’ll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.
>
> Respect your elders.
>
> **Don’t expect anyone else to support you.** Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you’ll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.
>
> Don’t mess too much with your hair or by the time you’re 40 it will look 85.
>
> **Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it.** Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it’s worth.
>
> But trust me on the sunscreen.”

The second speech I want to talk about is one by George Saunders. It was delivered at The College of Arts and Sciences' undergraduate convocation ceremony in May 2013. He talks about the importance of kindness and how moments when he failed to act with kindness is what he regrets most in his life.

Here is the transcript of the speech (there is also a book: [Congratulations, by the Way: Some Thoughts on Kindness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373298-congratulations-by-the-way)).

> Down through the ages, a traditional form has evolved for this type of speech, which is: Some old fart, his best years behind him, who, over the course of his life, has made a series of dreadful mistakes (that would be me), gives heartfelt advice to a group of shining, energetic young people, with all of their best years ahead of them (that would be you).
>
> And I intend to respect that tradition.
>
> Now, one useful thing you can do with an old person, in addition to borrowing money from them, or asking them to do one of their old-time “dances,” so you can watch, while laughing, is ask: “Looking back, what do you regret?” And they’ll tell you. Sometimes, as you know, they’ll tell you even if you haven’t asked. Sometimes, even when you’ve specifically requested they not tell you, they’ll tell you.
>
> So: What do I regret?
>
> Being poor from time to time? Not really.
>
> Working terrible jobs, like “knuckle-puller in a slaughterhouse?” (And don’t even ASK what that entails.) No. I don’t regret that.
>
> Skinny-dipping in a river in Sumatra, a little buzzed, and looking up and seeing like 300 monkeys sitting on a pipeline, pooping down into the river, the river in which I was swimming, with my mouth open, naked? And getting deathly ill afterwards, and staying sick for the next seven months? Not so much.
>
> Do I regret the occasional humiliation? Like once, playing hockey in front of a big crowd, including this girl I really liked, I somehow managed, while falling and emitting this weird whooping noise, to score on my own goalie, while also sending my stick flying into the crowd, nearly hitting that girl? No. I don’t even regret that.
>
> But here’s something I do regret:
>
> In seventh grade, this new kid joined our class. In the interest of confidentiality, her convocation speech name will be Ellen. Ellen was small, shy. She wore these blue cat’s-eye glasses that, at the time, only old ladies wore. When nervous, which was pretty much always, she had a habit of taking a strand of hair into her mouth and chewing on it.
>
> So she came to our school and our neighborhood, and was mostly ignored, occasionally teased (“Your hair taste good?”--that sort of thing). I could see this hurt her. I still remember the way she’d look after such an insult: eyes cast down, a little gut-kicked, as if, having just been reminded of her place in things, she was trying, as much as possible, to disappear. After awhile she’d drift away, hair-strand still in her mouth. At home, I imagined, after school, her mother would say, you know: “How was your day, sweetie?” and she’d say, “Oh, fine.” And her mother would say, “Making any friends?” and she’d go, “Sure, lots.”
>
> Sometimes I’d see her hanging around alone in her front yard, as if afraid to leave it.
>
> And then--they moved. That was it. No tragedy, no big final hazing.
>
> One day she was there, next day she wasn’t.
>
> End of story.
>
> Now, why do I regret that? Why, forty-two years later, am I still thinking about it? Relative to most of the other kids, I was actually pretty nice to her. I never said an unkind word to her. In fact, I sometimes even (mildly) defended her.
>
> But still. It bothers me.
>
> So here’s something I know to be true, although it’s a little corny, and I don’t quite know what to do with it:
>
> **What I regret most in my life are failures of kindness.**
>
> **Those moments when another human being was there, in front of me, suffering, and I responded ... sensibly. Reservedly. Mildly.**
>
> Or, to look at it from the other end of the telescope: Who, in your life, do you remember most fondly, with the most undeniable feelings of warmth?
>
> Those who were kindest to you, I bet.
>
> It’s a little facile, maybe, and certainly hard to implement, but I’d say, as a goal in life, you could do worse than: **Try to be kinder.**
>
> Now, the million-dollar question: What’s our problem? Why aren’t we kinder?
>
> Here’s what I think:
>
> Each of us is born with a series of built-in confusions that are probably somehow Darwinian. These are: (1) we’re central to the universe (that is, our personal story is the main and most interesting story, the only story, really); (2) we’re separate from the universe (there’s us and then, out there, all that other junk - dogs and swing-sets, and the State of Nebraska and low-hanging clouds and, you know, other people), and (3) we’re permanent (death is real, o.k., sure - for you, but not for me).
>
> Now, we don’t really believe these things - intellectually we know better - but we believe them viscerally, and live by them, and they cause us to prioritize our own needs over the needs of others, even though what we really want, in our hearts, is to be less selfish, more aware of what’s actually happening in the present moment, more open, and more loving.
>
> So, the second million-dollar question: How might we DO this? How might we become more loving, more open, less selfish, more present, less delusional, etc., etc?
>
> Well, yes, good question.
>
> Unfortunately, I only have three minutes left.
>
> So let me just say this. There are ways. You already know that because, in your life, there have been High Kindness periods and Low Kindness periods, and you know what inclined you toward the former and away from the latter. Education is good; immersing ourselves in a work of art: good; prayer is good; meditation’s good; a frank talk with a dear friend; establishing ourselves in some kind of spiritual tradition - recognizing that there have been countless really smart people before us who have asked these same questions and left behind answers for us.
>
> One thing in our favor: some of this “becoming kinder” happens naturally, with age. It might be a simple matter of attrition: as we get older, we come to see how useless it is to be selfish - how illogical, really. We come to love other people and are thereby counter-instructed in our own centrality. We get our butts kicked by real life, and people come to our defense, and help us, and we learn that we’re not separate, and don’t want to be. We see people near and dear to us dropping away, and are gradually convinced that maybe we too will drop away (someday, a long time from now). Most people, as they age, become less selfish and more loving. I think this is true. The great Syracuse poet, Hayden Carruth, said, in a poem written near the end of his life, that he was “mostly Love, now.”
>
> And so, a prediction, and my heartfelt wish for you: as you get older, your self will diminish and you will grow in love. YOU will gradually be replaced by LOVE. If you have kids, that will be a huge moment in your process of self-diminishment. You really won’t care what happens to YOU, as long as they benefit. That’s one reason your parents are so proud and happy today. One of their fondest dreams has come true: you have accomplished something difficult and tangible that has enlarged you as a person and will make your life better, from here on in, forever.
>
> Congratulations, by the way.
>
> When young, we’re anxious - understandably - to find out if we’ve got what it takes. Can we succeed? Can we build a viable life for ourselves? But you - in particular you, of this generation - may have noticed a certain cyclical quality to ambition. You do well in high-school, in hopes of getting into a good college, so you can do well in the good college, in the hopes of getting a good job, so you can do well in the good job so you can ... .
>
> And this is actually o.k. If we’re going to become kinder, that process has to include taking ourselves seriously - as doers, as accomplishers, as dreamers. We have to do that, to be our best selves.
>
> **Still, accomplishment is unreliable. “Succeeding,” whatever that might mean to you, is hard, and the need to do so constantly renews itself (success is like a mountain that keeps growing ahead of you as you hike it), and there’s the very real danger that “succeeding” will take up your whole life, while the big questions go untended.**
>
> So, quick, end-of-speech advice: Since, according to me, your life is going to be a gradual process of becoming kinder and more loving: Hurry up. Speed it along. Start right now.
>
> Because kindness, it turns out, is hard - it starts out all rainbows and puppy dogs, and expands to include ... well, everything.
>
> There’s a confusion in each of us, a sickness, really: selfishness. But there’s also a cure. So be a good and proactive and even somewhat desperate patient on your own behalf - seek out the most efficacious anti-selfishness medicines, energetically, for the rest of your life.
>
> Do all the other things, the ambitious things - travel, get rich, get famous, innovate, lead, fall in love, make and lose fortunes, swim naked in wild jungle rivers (after first having it tested for monkey poop) - but as you do, to the extent that you can, **err in the direction of kindness. Do those things that incline you toward the big questions, and avoid the things that would reduce you and make you trivial. That luminous part of you that exists beyond personality - your soul, if you will - is as bright and shining as any that has ever been. Bright as Shakespeare’s, bright as Gandhi’s, bright as Mother Theresa’s. Clear away everything that keeps you separate from this secret luminous place. Believe it exists, come to know it better, nurture it, share its fruits tirelessly.**
>
> And someday, in 80 years, when you’re 100, and I’m 134, and we’re both so kind and loving we’re nearly unbearable, drop me a line, let me know how your life has been. I hope you will say: It has been so wonderful.

So remember to be nice. And to wear sunscreen.
